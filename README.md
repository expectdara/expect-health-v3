Utah OAIP Pilot Application — Interactive Platform Demo

## Deploy to Vercel

1. Push this folder to a GitHub repo
2. Connect the repo to Vercel
3. Vercel auto-detects the static site and deploys

## What This Is

Fully functional clinical workflow demo:
- Patient intake with 5 validated instruments (ICIQ-UI SF, ICIQ-FLUTS, ICIQ-FLUTSsex, GUPI-Female, Pain Assessment)
- AI scoring, diagnosis classification, and treatment plan generation
- PT review with full editing (exercises, adjuncts, goals, precautions, encounter note)
- Pre-approval guardrails (review time, red flags, consistency, rationale, note review)
- OAIP compliance dashboard with 4-category checklist
- Full audit logging

## Note

This is the interactive prototype. Production deployment requires HIPAA-compliant backend (Convex/Supabase/Firebase).
